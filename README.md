### **Program 3-1**   
```
Working with the procedure.   
Example 1. Shows how to perform simple addition using registers and assembler instructions.   
Example 2. Comparing two numbers stored in memory and branch to different labels depending on how large the number is.
(PROC, CMP, JE, JG, JL, JMP...)   
```   
### **Program 3-2**   
```
Solve through the procedure.   
```   
(a+b)/(a-b)   
### **Program 3-3**   
```
Enter 3 signed integers from the keyboard and output the maximum.   
   
Solve through the procedure.   
Do not use CMP.   
(.IF, .ELSE, .ENDIF)   
```
